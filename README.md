# Airlines-Delay
Show with a table (or ideally with a graph) the total number of flights, on January, in 2008.
For each month of data available from January 2008 (inclusive), obtain many airports with the greatest reduction in the number of flights.


goals:
1-Develop a predictive model of the GAIN variable using somee methods. Briefly justify the goodness / power of the model developed.
2-Generate a model using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and SVM that allows us to predict the probability of a flight delay.

We want to know the origins with the highest and lowest probability of being delayed, as well as the destinations with the highest and lowest probability of being delayed. Finally, we will obtain the probability of suffering a delay based on the month, day of the month, day of the week and time of day and we will compare those results with those obtained in the first exercise.
